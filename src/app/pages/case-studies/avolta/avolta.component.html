    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Avolta is a global company with distributed corporate teams relying on internal digital tools for daily operations and collaboration. The platform was
      built on <span class="highlight">SharePoint</span> and had grown organically over time, resulting in fragmented experiences and inefficient workflows.
    </p>
    <p>The goal of the project was to transform the platform into a more <span class="highlight">coherent and scalable internal product</span>.</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fragmented information architecture and unclear navigation</li>
      <li>Low adoption and engagement across teams</li>
      <li>Inconsistent UI patterns and components</li>
      <li>High cognitive load when performing everyday tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My role</h2>
    <p>
      I worked as <span class="highlight">Product Designer</span>, collaborating with stakeholders, product owners and developers to understand user needs and
      redesign the platform.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stakeholder interviews and user research</li>
      <li>Problem framing and requirements definition</li>
      <li>Information architecture and user flows</li>
      <li>Wireframes, UI design and design system alignment</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
      The project started with <span class="highlight">problem framing</span>: understanding business objectives, technical constraints and user pain points
      through interviews and analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mapped key user journeys, restructured the navigation and defined a modular layout system. Solutions were explored through wireframes and prototypes,
      followed by
      <span class="highlight">iterative feedback sessions</span> with stakeholders and end users.
    </p>

    <h2>Key product decisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplified navigation to support core user journeys</li>
      <li>Standardised components to ensure consistency and scalability</li>
      <li>Clear content prioritisation based on user goals</li>
      <li>Improved accessibility and readability for daily usage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The redesigned platform resulted in a <span class="highlight">clearer and more intuitive internal product</span>, reducing friction in everyday workflows
      and increasing overall adoption across teams and stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new structure also enabled the company to <span class="highlight">scale the platform over time</span>, making future features easier to integrate and
      maintain.
