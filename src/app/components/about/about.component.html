        </div>
        <p>
          I’m a Product Designer with over 4 years of experience working on digital products in complex environments, mainly within
          <span class="highlight">B2B, SaaS and enterprise platforms</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background combines <span class="highlight">UX research, UI design, design systems and frontend development</span>, which allows me to understand
          both the strategic and the technical side of a product.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work at the <span class="highlight">UX intersection of user needs, business goals and technical constraints</span>, collaborating with
          cross-functional teams to deliver products that are not only usable, but also effective and scalable.
