        <p>I'm a UX/UI Designer working on complex digital products, mostly in B2B and enterprise environments.</p>
        <p>I enjoy solving messy problems, designing systems, and making tools that people actually want to use.</p>

        <p>
          Over the past years, I've worked on internal platforms, dashboards and customer-facing products, often collaborating with product managers, developers
          and stakeholders to translate business needs into clear, usable interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of projects, I come from an art background, which shapes how I approach design: I care about composition, rhythm and visual balance as much as
          usability.
